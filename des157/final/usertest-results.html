    <h3>
        Three significant observations that emerged through testing was: 
    </h3>
        <ol class="observations">
            <li>
                The most obvious comment I received was the lack of content on the right column. 
                Originally, I had images of my pets under all the name titles but thought that was a 
                little repetitive since there’s also an image of the pets in the overlay. Once I took 
                them out, I couldn’t think of a replacement so I left it blank in hopes of some good 
                ideas in our feedback today. A few things I heard was to possibly play with the name 
                of each pet and enlarge it. It could be fun to have, for example, “Medusa” print in a 
                large text and a graphic of a snake slithering through the letters. Another suggestion I
                 heard was to possibly add a gif or video that plays when the mouse hovers over. 
                <br><br>
                I’m planning on adding some sort of scroll to the right column if possible. Or I was 
                thinking about going along with the idea of enlarging the text and adding some cool graphics with it. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Another interesting observation is how much the overlay really worked well for the page. Every user 
                testing my page mentioned how much they enjoyed the overlay. A couple of suggestions was to change 
                the width and height of the overlay so that all of the content fit and no scroll is needed. Another 
                suggestion is to possibly make the image smaller and create a square clipping mask versus a circle 
                clipping mask for the image. Overall, this is the one area that worked really well and was easily 
                accessible for the users. The animation for the graphic also worked well but one user mentioned 
                how the infinity loop was a bit too much everytime she hovered over the image. 
                <br><br>
                I plan on making the image slightly smaller and more squared out. I also want to make the width and height of 
                the overlay a little larger to make sure everything fits on screen and no scrolling is needed. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Lastly, I received a lot of feedback on the design aspect of the buttons. One user commented that it was pretty 
                intuitive to click on the names of the pet due to the color of the text. Another user commented how it could be 
                fun to have an enlargement of the text when hovered over in order to bring some sort of animation into the text. 
                I agree with both of those suggestions. Although I want things to be intuitive, I also want it to be exciting. 
                Right now, it’s looking a little flat. 
                <br><br>
                I’m planning on maybe making 4 columns, one for the title, and then one for each of my pets that way it fills up 
                the space a little bit more. Once on hover, you can see a slither of the image or the cool graphic with the pet name.
