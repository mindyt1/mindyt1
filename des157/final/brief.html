    <p>What I really like about Kenta Toshikura’s portfolio is how interactive everything is. Just with a 
        swipe of your mouse, everything shifts with it. I like the fluidity of it and how there’s this “liquid” 
        design to it. One thing that I’ve come to learn (and love) is that the less the user needs to actually 
        “think” about the design interface, the better. If users are able to use your site without having any 
        sort of trouble, you’re doing your job correctly. With this example, I really like how she leaves parts 
        of the other circles on the top and bottom therefore creating this notion of possibly swiping up and down.
        Something I want to incorporate is the swiping motion versus clicking up or down. I want to change my layout
        and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
