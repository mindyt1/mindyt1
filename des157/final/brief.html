    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <button class="accordion">Project Summary:</button>
    <div class= "panel">
        <p>I want to recreate my "Every Picture" project and focus on the aesthetics and user experience!</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Comparison Project 1:</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p><a href="https://kentatoshikura.com/"></a></p>
    <p>What I really like about Kenta Toshikura’s portfolio is how interactive everything is. Just with a 
        swipe of your mouse, everything shifts with it. I like the fluidity of it and how there’s this “liquid” 
        design to it. One thing that I’ve come to learn (and love) is that the less the user needs to actually 
        “think” about the design interface, the better. If users are able to use your site without having any 
        sort of trouble, you’re doing your job correctly. With this example, I really like how she leaves parts 
        of the other circles on the top and bottom therefore creating this notion of possibly swiping up and down.
        Something I want to incorporate is the swiping motion versus clicking up or down. I want to change my layout
        and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Comparison Project 2:</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p><a href="https://www.virgileguinard.fr/series/lamour-jacquemus/"></a></p>
    <p>
        Something I find that works really well with this website is the use of colors. Personally, I feel an emotion 
        for each of the colors the designer is trying to convey that matches the gallery it unlocks. I like that there’s 
        an element of surprise and that you don’t know what’s under all those colors. I think that really worked well 
        for me so I want to mimic that element of surprise in my project as well. I’m also obsessed with gradients lately 
        so this is right up my alley. In terms of user experience, I like that you can drag and scroll around to find what 
        interests you. It feels like a never-ending gallery! Something I would suggest that I think will make the website 
        better is to have one image showing at all times that way users have an initial idea of what is going on. Right as 
        you hover your mouse over, the image shows up but to quicken that move even faster, it would be cool to have a fade 
        in of various images.

    <button class="accordion">Project Goals:</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>My main goal this time around is to make my project more visually appealing as well as more interaction and animation.
            As of right now, everything is working fine but I want users to be able to experiement and interact with my page a little
            more. User exerience is really important to me so that's what I want to focus on. As you notice in the two website comparison,
            I like my pages to fill up as well as have a lot of movement. This is something I want to work on for the second version of my
            "Every Picture" page. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Design Strategies:</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The design strategy that I want to focus on is predictability. As mentioned before, I want users to be able to figure out automatically
        what they can and can't control. When everything is predictable, the user experience flows nicely as users don't have to question anything.
        On top of that, I also want to give users control of the experience. 
    </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Experience Goals:</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>I want to change my layout and make it a scrolling type verses how it is now. I also want to create a change in color or images (tbd) based on hover.
        Once clicked upon, I want to create a gallery of some sort that can display various graphics that represent things like their hobbies, their favorite
        food, or their environment.
