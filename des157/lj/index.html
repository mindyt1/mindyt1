        <h2>Learning Journal 1: Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time>10/21/2021</time>
        <p>If I was just starting out in UX/UI and Web Development, I would find this article informative. 
            But based on my past experiences in DES 112 and DES 117, I, personally, found this article not as helpful. 
            I felt like I know a lot of these tips and tricks already. For example, the article talks about adding labels as a
            form of captions or asking the easy questions first. Based on my analysis in Des 112, I’ve also come to notice these 
            attributes really do help with the user’s experience. There were a few things that I did learn though! For one, 
            I didn’t know we should avoid using asterisks (“*”). The article mentions how you should avoid labeling the required 
            aspects of the interaction and label the optional one instead but I feel like I see a fair amount of asterisks on websites 
            as well (the most notable one is the Google Forms). Overall, I enjoyed the reading and found it slightly informative.
