        <p> When I think of modals, I mainly think of Login/Sign-Up Forms. I agree with the writer that it's an effective use for 
            grabbing the user's attention but can sometimes come off as "annoying". One thing I found interesting was how modals should not
            surprise the users by popping up unexpectedly. I guess it makes sense to have some sort of button that activates the modal but I
            kind of don't mind a pop-up either. I feel like I've seen a few websites that have an automatic login pop-up and it doesn't change
            my user experience personally.

            On another note, I enjoyed reading the article and found some very useful tips. I raelly liked how the writer provided reasoning behind
            every practice listed. For example, she mentions how you can get the user to focus on the modal by using the lightbox effect and darkening 
            the background. She claims that this will draw attention to the modal and show that the parent page can't be interacted with as long as the
            modal is open.

        <h2>Learning Journal 1: Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time>12/21/2021</time>
        <p> If I was just starting out in UX/UI and Web Development, I would find this article informative. 
            But based on my past experiences in DES 112 and DES 117, I, personally, found this article not as helpful. 
            I felt like I know a lot of these tips and tricks already. For example, the article talks about adding labels as a
            form of captions or asking the easy questions first. Based on what I learned in Des 112, I’ve also come to notice these 
            attributes really do help with the user’s experience. There was one tip I found interesting! I didn’t know we should avoid 
            using asterisks (“*”). The article mentions how you should avoid labeling the required aspects of the interaction and label 
            the optional one instead but I feel like I see a fair amount of asterisks on websites as well (the most notable one is the 
            Google Forms). Overall, I enjoyed the reading and found it slightly informative.
