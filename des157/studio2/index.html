            <h2>Medusa, The Corn Snake!</h2>
             <img src="images/medusa_garden.png" alt="myroom" width=600px>

             <p>
                Medusa is my albino corn snake! She loves adventure and cherishes every moment she gets out of her
                cage! She's one of the easiest, chillest animals to take care of! She eats baby mice and you only have 
                to feed her every two weeks! On most days, she just stays in her cage and sleeps. Corn snakes are known to
                be quite sneaky and fast so make sure you always have an eye on them. They can easily slither away when not
                paying attention!

            <p>
                Milo is my mini poodle/maltese mix! He's the oldest of the three and the craziest! He loves attention and
                a good walk! He's probably the most spoiled as well! My mom loves him more than she's willing to admit and
                brings him everywhere (even family vacations!). When he's not running around like a crazy person, he loves a good
                cuddle or a nice nap. The one thing he hates the most in this world is a bath. >_<

            <h2>Goldie, The Goldfish!</h2>
            <img src="images/goldie_beach.png" alt="goldfish" width=600px>
            <p>
                Goldie is the most calm out of them all. She's my pet goldfish that I got last year! She stays in her tank and
                swims back and forth all day. When I'm having a bad day, I like to stare at her (she calms me down!). My dog also
                likes to watch her with me. She currently resides in Alameda, CA but I'm thinking of taking her back with me to Davis
                the next time I go home!!
